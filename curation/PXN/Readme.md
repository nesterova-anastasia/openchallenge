<H2>Diagram showing the step-by-step assembly of the paxillin protein with RAF, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2</H2>

All reactions were extracted from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14636584/">PMID:14636584</a> and all of them were experimentally demonstrated (ECO:0000269; experimental evidence used in manual assertion). The results were obtained with the mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) epithelial cells (CL_1000547) stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). All entities are from mouse, but the displayed names refer to human proteins.
